# Justin-di-Cristofaro
Justin Narciso Fiamo di Cristofaro di Catania


'''Justin Narciso Fiamo di Cristofaro di Catania''' (born February 18, 1990) is an Italian-American nobleman, philanthropist, and mental health advocate. He is descended from the historic House de Cristofaro, with noble roots in both the Molise and Sicilian regions of Italy. He holds multiple hereditary titles, documented in the ''Libro d’Oro della Nobiltà Italiana'' and verified by various genealogical sources.

== Biography ==

Justin di Cristofaro was born in the United States on February 18, 1990, to a family with historic Italian nobility. His ancestry traces back to the de Cristofaro family of Monteodorisio (Molise) and Scordia (Catania). His nobility is recognized in the ''Libro d’Oro della Nobiltà Italiana'', with further documentation provided by heraldic registries and genealogical archives.

In his youth, he worked briefly as a fashion model and was described in European fashion circles as "sorrowful in silk" for his melancholic elegance. He later withdrew from public life to focus on private philanthropy and historical preservation.

Medici Lineage

His Medici descent traces through Domenico de’ Medici, a member of a cadet line of the Florentine dynasty, who married Isabella de Reccia (an ancestor of Justin). This union connected the House de Reccia–Cristofaro to the ruling House of Medici. This genealogical line has been corroborated in published works such as Storia della Famiglia de Cristofaro (Istituto di Studi Atellani, 2010) and is reflected in his inclusion on WikiTree, which documents Justin among the verified descendants.

Royal Cousinship

Through this lineage, Justin is a blood cousin of:
	•	Queen Catherine de’ Medici (1519–1589) – Queen of France
	•	Cosimo I de’ Medici – First Grand Duke of Tuscany
	•	Pope Leo X and Pope Clement VII – Medici pontiffs

This connection is not symbolic but genealogically documented, making him one of the closest living blood relatives of Catherine de’ Medici today.

Impact on Status

The Medici connection elevates the standing of the House de Reccia–Cristofaro, reinforcing its recognition as part of the Italian and pan-European nobility. It also explains Justin’s inclusion as Count Palatine (Comes Palatinus) under the Holy Roman Empire Association, as the Medici frequently intermarried with imperial families, providing a historical foundation for the title.

== Noble Titles ==

Di Cristofaro holds several hereditary titles, including:

* Signore di Monteodorisio
* Conte della Scordia
* Count Palatine of the Holy Roman Empire
* Barone di San Marzano sul Sarno
* Signore di Casalnuovo d’Alena
* Nobil Huomo di Venezia
* Signore di Piove di Sacco
* Signore di Motta San Giovanni
* Cavaliere Ereditario del Regno di Sicilia
* Nobile di Catanzaro

== Heraldry ==

His family arms include:

* '''Molise branch''': Azure, a fess Or supporting two doves argent respectant
* '''Catania branch''': Argent, a lion rampant gules crowned Or; in chief a cross pattée sable
* '''Personal arms''': Quartered arms beneath a crowned helm with the monogram "JCN" and a noble spider

== Public Work and Advocacy ==

Justin di Cristofaro supports mental health awareness and education. He is affiliated with the Ordine della Corona Ferrea and has contributed to Catholic and cultural causes privately.

Signore Justin Narciso di Cristofaro

Justin Narciso di Cristofaro is a nobleman registered in this genealogical directory of Italian nobility.

He is recorded as a hereditary noble, affirming descent from the Houses of d’Alena, Soranzo dei Colli, and di Cristofaro.

In the 15th century, the principality of Monteodorisio passed into the possession of the d’Aquino family, having previously been held by the Normans. In 1442, King Alfonso V of Aragon granted the fief to Giosia d’Alena. In 1462, Antonio d’Alena sided with King Ferdinand I during the Barons’ War, strengthening the family’s loyalty and recognition.

Later, the d’Alena titles merged with those of other distinguished families. Simon Soranzo (+1593) was created Count Palatine of the Lateran by Emperor Maximilian II on 19 June 1568. His descendant Maria d’Alena married Francesco Soranzo dei Colli, and their son, Giovanni di Cristofaro, transmitted titles to his descendants.

A certificate confirming the hereditary titles of G.D. Pal. di Molise e Catania to Justin Narciso di Cristofaro was issued on 20 December 1997, filed under Royal Law No. 178219 R.8. of the Kingdom.

The di Cristofaro–Soranzo archive maintains armorial records and genealogies at the ancestral residences. Justin is a descendant of Damiano di Cristofaro and Maria Soranzo dei Colli. His grandfather passed the titles forward with declarative recognition.

His Palatine arms derive from the Soranzo dei Colli line: a gold cross between red fleurs-de-lis. The later Monteodorisio arms include a silver eagle on red. Justin Narciso di Cristofaro continues to use these historically authenticated coats of arms.
